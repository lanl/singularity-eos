  # mauneyc 20230525 SOOOOO..... HDF5 detection has a lot of unremarked on
  # dependencies and build checkpoints that turn this into an inscrutable
  # failure at times. here's what I've found, though I can't really make sense
  # of when/how/where this applies 0.) TODO one or all of these may be due to
  # modifying `HDF5_` output vars before doing `find_package`, which seems to
  # produce pathological behavior. Test this soon. 1.) if 'C' component is
  # requested, 'enable_language(C)' needs to be done beforehand. otherwise,
  # FindHDF5.cmake _may_ fail to detect anything. 1a.) I say _may_ because this
  # behavior is sporadic across CMake/HDF5 versions. 2.) the 'C' component _may_
  # be required. On some installs, 'HL' is sufficent; on others, both are
  # needed. 3.) MPI behavior: rather than just *tell* us what MPI libraries it
  # needs, we have to just guess. Using both MPI_C and MPI_CXX as a
  # 'kitchen-sink' approach is what works (currently) although this may be an
  # issue in other platforms. Unfortunately, this won't give a configuration
  # error, as the target check isn't performed until export. Will have to think
  # about trying to catch these issues.
