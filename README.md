[![Tests](https://github.com/lanl/singularity-eos/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/lanl/singularity-eos/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

A collection of closure models and tools useful for multiphysics codes

## Components

- `eos` contains the analytic and tabular equation of state infrastructure
- `closure` contains mixed cell closure models. Currently pressure-temperature equilibrium is supported. Requires `eos`.
- `utils/sesame2spiner` converts sesame tables to 

## To Build

At its most basic:
```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:lanl/singularity-eos.git
cd singularity-eos
mkdir bin
cd bin
cmake ..
make
```

### To Make tests

To build the tests, in the `singularity-eos` root directory, clone `singularity-eos-data`, which is a [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) directory. First you need to install git-lfs. This only needs to be done once. Download git-lfs via, e.g.,
```bash
apt install git-lfs
```
and then add the requisite files into your home directory via
```bash
git lfs install
```

Then, in the singularity-eos root directory:
```bash
git clone git@gitlab.lanl.gov:singularity/singularity-eos-data.git
mkdir -p bin
cd bin
cmake -DSINGULARITY_BUILD_TESTS=ON ..
make -j
make test
```

### Build Options

A number of options are avaialable for compiling:

| Option                            | Default | Comment                                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SINGULARITY_USE_HDF5              | ON      | Enables HDF5. Required for SpinerEOS, StellarCollapseEOS, and sesame2spiner          |
| SINGULARITY_USE_FORTRAN           | ON      | Enable Fortran API for equation of state                                             |
| SINGULARITY_USE_KOKKOS            | OFF     | Uses Kokkos as the portability backend. Currently only Kokkos is supported for GPUs. |
| SINGULARITY_USE_EOSPAC            | OFF     | Link against EOSPAC. Needed for sesame2spiner and some tests.                        |
| SINGULARITY_USE_CUDA              | OFF     | Target nvidia GPUs via cuda. Currently requires Kokkos.                              |
| SINGULARITY_USE_KOKKOSKERNELS     | OFF     | Use Kokkos Kernels for linear algebra. Needed for mixed cell closure models on GPU   |
| SINGULARITY_BUILD_CLOSURE         | ON      | Builds mixed cell closure machinery for multi-material problems                      |
| SINGULARITY_BUILD_TESTS           | OFF     | Build test infrastructure.                                                           |
| SINGULARITY_TEST_SESAME           | OFF     | Test the Sesame table readers                                                        |
| SINGULARITY_TEST_STELLAR_COLLAPSE | OFF     | Test the Stellar Collapse table readers                                              |
| SINGULARITY_BUILD_SESAME2SPINER   | OFF     | Builds the conversion tool sesame2spiner which makes files readable by SpinerEOS     |
| SINGULARITY_INVERT_AT_SETUP       | OFF     | For tests, pre-invert eospac tables.                                                 |
| SINGULARITY_BETTER_DEBUG_FLAGS    | ON      | Enables nicer GPU debug flags. May interfere with in-tree builds as a submodule      |
| SINGULARITY_HIDE_MORE_WARNINGS    | OFF     | Makes warnings less verbose. May interfere with in-tree builds as a submodule        |
| SINGULARITY_SUBMODULE_MODE        | OFF     | Sets cmake flags for in-tree builds                                                  |

### Building on Darwin power9 nodes with the IBM xl compiler

```bash
git clone --recursive https://gitlab.lanl.gov/singularity/singularity-eos.git
cd singularity-eos
mkdir bin && cd bin
source /usr/projects/eap/dotfiles/.bashrc xl reset
module switch ibm/xlc-16.1.1.5-xlf-16.1.1.5 ibm/xlc-16.1.1.7-xlf-16.1.1.7-gcc-7.4.0
export FC="xlf_r -F/usr/projects/opt/ppc64le/ibm/xlf-16.1.1.7/xlf/16.1.1/etc/xlf.cfg.rhel.7.8.gcc.7.4.0.cuda.10.1"
module load cmake/3.17.3
cd /build/directory
