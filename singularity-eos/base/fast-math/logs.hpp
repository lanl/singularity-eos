/*
 * These functions are for use when moving to and from the gridding space
 * for Spiner grids.
 *
 * The core idea here is to move onto a grid that's roughly
 * logarithmically spaced. It doesn't actually matter if that grid is
 * EXACTLY logarithmic. Just that it is approximately so.
 * There are however some constraints that do matter:
 *
 * 1. The function we use to translate to "grid space" must be
 * precise, meaning you get the same answer each time.
 *
 * 2. The function must be invertible, meaning you can go back to
 * "linear space." Ideally it is also continuous.
 *
 * 3. The function and its inverse must be fast.
 *
 * To meet these constraints, we approximate a logarithm by using
 * frexp and ldexp to split a real number into its mantissa + exponent
 * in base 2. The mantissa is a real number on the interval [0.5, 1)
 * and the exponent is an integer such that
 *
 * mantissa * 2^exponent = number
 *
 * To truly take the log, one needs to take the log of the mantissa.
 * However, the first term in the logarithm's Taylor series is linear.
 * Thus a linear approximation to log, for small numbers is valid.
 * We use that linear approximation, which turns out to be:
 *
 * 2*(mantissa - 1)
 *
 * So that mantissa = 0.5 returns log_2(0.5) = -1 and mantissa (1)
 * yields 0.
 *
 * Then the approximate log of the whole thing is the approximation of
 * the log of the mantissa, plus the exponent:
 *
 * 2*(mantissa - 1) + exponent
 *
 * Which is a continuous, invertible function that approximates lg
 * only relatively accurately. The absolute difference of this
 * function from lg is about 0.1 at its largest. This translates to a
 * relative difference of at most 25%.
 *
 * However, we don't mind this difference, as we're only interested in
 * generating a grid spacing "close enough" to log spacing. As long as
 * we can go into and out of "grid space" reliably and quickly, we're
 * happy, and this function is an EXACT map into and out of that
 * space.
