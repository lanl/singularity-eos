# sesame2spiner

Self-contained tool that uses `EOSPAC` to read `SESAME` tables and convert to Spiner HDF format.

## Download

```bash
git clone --recursive git@gitlab.lanl.gov:jonahm/sesame2spiner.git
```

## Dependencies

`sesame2spiner` requires the following header-only libraries, which are provided via `git` submodules:
- [Spiner](https://gitlab.lanl.gov/jonahm/spiner)
- [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)
- [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)

It also requires the following pre-installed libraries
- [EOSPAC](https://laws.lanl.gov/projects/data/eos/eospacReleases.php)
- [HDF5](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/support)

## Build and install

`sesame2spiner` uses a simple Makefile. Cloning and then typing `make`
will build the binary and run the tests.

You may need to change include libraries. In particular, you may need
to set the following flags:
- `EOSPAC_INCLUDE`, the `-I` flag for EOSPAC headers
- `EOSPAC_LIB`, the `-L` flag for EOSPAC 
- `EOSPAC_LINK`, the `-l` flag for EOSPAC. In particular, you may want to set the `rpath`.
- `CC`, the compiler. You likely want this to be the path to `h5c++`
  for `hdf5-serial`. You can also change it to, say, `icc` and simply
  point the appropriate include and link flags `INCLUDE_FLAGS`,
  `LFLAGS` to your `hdf5` installation.
  
Currently there is no `make install`. For now, please just copy the
binary to where you want it.

## Example usage

```bash
jonahm@sn-fey1:$ ./sesame2spiner -h
Usage: ./sesame2spiner[-p] [-h] <parameter file>

	 <parameter file>: input file in json format
	-p: print metadata associated with materials in parameter file
	-h: print this message
